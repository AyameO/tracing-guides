#### Buildings and Walls

There's a lot of construction going on in Canaan, especially on the east side in Onaville. We're interested in the following types of area:

- *Buildings*. These will look like "normal" structures, with roofs, walls, etc. They may be constructed from primitive materials.
- *Buildings under construction*. These will look like walls, but about the size of a building and with partitions for rooms. These could be dark (indicating that a foundation has been dug), lighter (indicating a filled-in foundation, maybe with short walls), or white with shadows (the walls are getting taller)
- *Property walls*. The walls will be obvious because they cover a larger area than buildings under construction.

To trace, select the Area tool (Shortcut: 3) and draw around the building/wall. If you don't see the "Building under construction" type, try searching for it in the search box. 

Note that once you've traced a building, you can square the corners easily by hovering and clicking the icon (Shortcut: s)
