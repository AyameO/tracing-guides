####Getting Started

First, make sure you're using the right background imagery. iD Editor will default to using Bing aerial, but for this area we have high-res drone imagery.

We'll be using the default Bing aerial imagery layer for tracing. The background imagery can be difficult to see, but increasing the brightness will help

While editing you may encounter a situation where existing features exist that were drawn based on older imagery. 
Using the alignment arrows in ID editor you can align the new imagery to match the existing features. Now when you add
new features they will be aligned with the existing ones!
