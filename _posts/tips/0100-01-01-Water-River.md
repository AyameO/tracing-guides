Update Text and Add pictures A ditch is a small to medium depression built to channel water. Ditches can be used to move water for irrigation, drain water from low lying areas, and are often found along the roadside to prevent flooding and help keep roads open during the wet season.  Ditches usually flow to or from a larger body of water, such as a river or large pond.

Here is an example of a large ditch.  This ditch is used to drain water from adjacent fields so they can be used for agriculture purposes.  Notice the bridge and large truck in the photo.
