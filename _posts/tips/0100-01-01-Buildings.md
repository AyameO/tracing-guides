Tracing buildings takes good imagery and patience. Take your time and pay attention to angularity, alignment between buildings and reflecting the regularities between buildings. Buildings are traced as outlines of *where the building meets the ground*. This last piece is important. The roof outline is often easier to see in the imagery so you'll find it often traced in OpenStreetMap but it's wrong. The main challenge with tracing buildings is lack of detail in imagery.
