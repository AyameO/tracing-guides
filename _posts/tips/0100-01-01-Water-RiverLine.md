Linear feature
#### Waterway = River

Linear rivers and smaller and flow into Area rivers.  For this project, linear rivers are less than 15M wide.  Depending on the editor you are using you may not be able to measure the width.  If you do not have a measure tool, estimate the width of the river by comparing it to surrounding features.

Here is an example of a large ditch.  This ditch is used to drain water from adjacent fields so they can be used for agriculture purposes.  Notice the small bridge and large truck in the photo.
