#### highway = residential:

- This tag is used for roads accessing or around residential areas but which are not a classified or unclassified highway. Generally we would want you to classify a road this way you suspect that it is used mostly by people that live on the road. In practice this can be hard to determine without spending time in the area but if it is not a through road and is lined by residential buildings it is a good sign that it should be classified as residential. If your unsure than use 'unclassified'.
