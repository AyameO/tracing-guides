###Linear feature

The roads are all unpaved, but we want to distinguish between them. We will use two classifications: residential road and tertiary road. 

*Tertiary*. The most obvious, widest paths that you see should be classified as "tertiary roads". These roads are easily seen in the drone imagery and will seem wide enough for two cars to pass. Tertiary roads connect towns, villages and major streets.
