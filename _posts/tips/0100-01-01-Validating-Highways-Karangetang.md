* Highway tags are correct? Some mappers tag every highway as a track because they are not paved, but this is not a meaningful criteria in some developing countries considering the amount of unpaved roads. Check the wiki definitions, perhaps the [Highway_Tag_Africa](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Highway_Tag_Africa "OSM Wiki") is relevant & you should research there before going any further.
Road geometry. 
* Road Geometry. Some mappers do not put enough details and others too much (eg a node every 10 or 20 m even if the road is straight).  Deleting extra nodes if they actually make a straight road weave.
