#### Highway = Secondary:

Zilla roads (Secondary roads) are paved or hard surface roads.  Zilla roads are more narrow in width than Regional Highways, can can be hard to trace due the tree canopy adjacent to the road.  During seasonal flooding events Zilla roads can flood and become very muddy or impassable.  

Road classification was defined by the Roads and Highways Department of the Ministry of Communications (RHD).  This guidance came from the [Bangladesh OSM wiki](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/WikiProject_Bangladesh).
