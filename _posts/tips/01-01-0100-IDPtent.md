Point feature

### Tent = Yes

IDP tents in urban area are located in non built-up portions of a city.  They can usually be identified by one large bright orange or blue tent arranged in a small open area. 

Single tents are located in small areas usually not large enough to hold more than one or two tents.  In these cases there is very little open area surrounding the tent so the outline of the tent should be collected as an area.
