Point feature

### Tent = Yes

IDP tents in urban areas are located in non built-up portions of a city.  They can usually be identified by one large bright orange, blue, or white tent arranged in a small open area. 

Single tents are located in small areas not large enough to hold more than one or two total tents.  There often isn't much surrounding open area, in these cases just trace the outline of the tent.
