You will encounter three possible scenarios when updating IDP sites:

1. New IDP site: create a new area and tag appropriately
2. IDP site has closed: do not <b>delete</b> the existing area. Add a new <b>idp:status</b> tag with the 'closed' attribute and add a new <b>idp:source tag</b>
3. IDP site has increased or decreased in size: Add a new <b>idp:status</b> tag with the either an 'increase' or 'decrease' attribute and add a new <b>idp:source tag</b>
