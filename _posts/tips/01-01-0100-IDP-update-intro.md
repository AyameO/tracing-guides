You will encounter three possible scenarios when updating IDP sites:

1. New IDP site: create a new area and tag appropriately
2. IDP site is empty: do not <b>delete</b> the existing area. Update the <b>idp:status</b> tag with the 'empty' attribute and update the <b>check_date tag</b> with the date of the latest imagery
3. IDP site has increased or decreased in size: Update the <b>idp:status</b> tag with the either an 'increased' or 'decreased' attribute and update the <b>check_date tag</b> with the date of the latest imagery
