<h2 class="section-heading">About Malaria Prevention</h2>

<h4> Mozambique </h4><p> Milange and Morrumbala are located in the Southeastern part of Zambezia Province, Mozambique.  Zambezia is the largest district in the province and lines the southern Malawian border through the Chire River. Once remote mapping is complete, Peace Corps Volunteers and their Mozambican counterparts on the ground will use printed Field Papers to groundtruth and add local knowledge to the remotely traced base map. Morrumbala and Milange have high population density and will host IRS (indoor residual spraying) campaigns for malaria prevention in October 2015. The IRS campaigns are sponsored and implemented by the Presidentâ€™s Malaria Initiative (PMI), a collaboration between the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). Geographic data from OpenStreetMap will help to locate areas that have been reached by the IRS campaign and identify priority areas that have yet to be sprayed. </p><br>

<h4> Tracing Tips </h4>
<ul>
  <li> Save often when editing long linear features such as waterways or roads. These features are continuous and appear in multiple cells across the project area which can cause errors when edited by multiple users. </li>
  <li> Pay close attention to alignment of imagery and adjust when necessary. Imagery should be adjusted to match existing OSM data. </li>
 </ul>
