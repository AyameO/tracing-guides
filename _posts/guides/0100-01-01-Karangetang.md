<h2 class="section-heading">Karangetang and MapGive</h2>

Karangetang is one of the most active volcanoes in Indonesia, having erupted 41 times since 1675. The volcano is located on Siau Island which is inhabited by approximately 22,000 people. Tracing buildings, settlements and the road network will help disaster management agencies model risks posed by the volcano and aid in mitigation efforts. Through the MapGive project, the Humanitarian Information Unit (HIU) of the U.S. Department of State is providing the OpenStreetMap community access to updated satellite imagery services to help assist with humanitarian mapping. For the area around the volcano (High Priority area) you can use the imagery provided by HIU, while on the southern part of the island Bing imagery is sufficient.
