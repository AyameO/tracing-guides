<h2 class="section-heading">About Last Mile Health</h2>

 <p>Last Mile Health (LMH) works to provide high-quality healthcare to remote villages in Liberia through a community health worker (CHW) program. LMH needs maps of villages to help them do work in two counties of Liberia - Grand Gedeh and Rivercess. It will greatly aid in LMH's scale-up planning, CHW training, and routine program monitoring. It will also help them construct a sampling frame for a repeated cluster sample survey evaluation of their programs within the two counties.</p>
