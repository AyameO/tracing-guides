At approximately 11:56 a.m. local time—or 2:11 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time—on April 25, a magnitude 7.8 earthquake struck central Nepal at a shallow depth of approximately 15 kilometers (km), according to the U.S. Geological Survey. The epicenter of the earthquake was located approximately 77 km northwest of Kathmandu, Nepal’s capital city, and 73 km east of Pokhara, another major population center. More than 20 aftershocks—ranging between magnitude 4.5 and 6.6—followed the initial earthquake.
