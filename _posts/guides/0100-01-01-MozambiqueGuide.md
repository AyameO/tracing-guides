<h2 class="section-heading">About Malaria Prevention</h2>

<h4> Khulna, Bangladesh </h4><p>This mapping project directly supports agricultural programs in Bangladesh. Data created from this mapping effort will be used by USAID and its partners who are working with rural farming villages in Bangladesh. It is intended to help communities in the Khulna District improve land management and increase agricultural production.</p>
<p>The desired outcome from this project is to have an accurate and complete transportation network, along with features that can be used for agriculture such as rivers, ditches, ponds, and buildings. </p><br>

<h4> Tracing Tips </h4>
<ul>
  <li> Do not trace the rice paddies. Rice paddies are the dark green areas on either side of the river with small footpaths in between.</li>
